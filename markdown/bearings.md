Getting one's
## bearings

Note: I'm going to keep this part short: more knowledgeable people than I have
already covered how to get into the Open edX codebase in general, in this
conference.


Is it a
## welcoming
project?

Note: One of the first questions I had was what kind of an experience would it
be dealing with Open edX and its community.  There are several ways to gauge
this, but I didn't have time to read through reams of mailing lists posts.
By chance, though, I ran into this interesting tidbit about the Linux kernel:


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/bad_words_linux.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

Note: Two things: one, somebody went through the trouble of writing a script that
counts bad words in the Linux Kernel (source: linuxcounter.net); two, we all
know how contributing to Linux is such an easy, unstressed experience, where
everybody in the community holds your hand and you hear lutes playing in the
distance...  Right?


## Linux

- 17 million lines of code
- 350 bad words

Note: this comes to about 1 bad word every 50k lines of code.


## Open edX

- 577 thousand lines of code
- 1 bad word <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: This was a good sign: the project has 10 times less bad words per line of
code.


Well, what is it?
### "Holy crap the server broke!" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: Shall I take bets?  I can see people furiously grepping `edx-platform`.
Hint: it's the same single bad word in Linux 1.0, when Linus Torvalds was still
young and innocent.


## Correlation
does not imply
## causation

Note: But.. correlation does not imply causation, so let me get to the actual
story of how my contribution went, and we'll see how I - and edX - fared.
